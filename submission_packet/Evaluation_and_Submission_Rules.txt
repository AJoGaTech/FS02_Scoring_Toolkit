Submission Rules
================

1. Registered Participants can choose to make multiple submissions in any one or more tasks from the Fearless Steps challenge. 
   Participants not registered, but a part of the registered participants' team can also submit their system results.
   Submissions by researchers who did not register for the challenge and are not a part of any registered teams will not 
   be considered for the Challenge.

2. Submissions will only be accepted as long as they follow the format provided below and in the example submission packet.
   Every submission must abide by the following rules:
    
    2.a Submissions should be sent to FearlessSteps@utdallas.edu in an email titled: "FS02 SUBMISSION"
    
    2.b The email must contain one or more attachments of one or more submission packets, each in a compressed format.
        (REFER: Example submission packet provided with the FS02_Scoring_Toolkit: 
            https://github.com/AJoGaTech/FS02_Scoring_Toolkit)
    
    2.c A single compressed (.zip or .tar.gz) submission packet should contain 3 main items:
        i. System Description Document (.pdf file)
        
        ii. Dev (folder containing system outputs)
        
        iii. Eval (folder containing system outputs)    
    
    (REFER: "FS02_System_Description_eg.pdf" provided in the submission packet
        to understand the contents the 3 items must include)
    
    2.d Every submission packet should have the following File Naming convention:
        
        <email-id>_<task-name>_Submission_<system-number>.<extn>
        
        i.   email-id : This email-id has to match the email-id used to register for the Challenge 
                    (irrespective of who sends the submission packet).
        
        ii.  task-name : Must be one of the following:
                    { SAD , SID , SD_track1 , SD_track2, ASR_track1, ASR_track2 }
        
        iii. system-number : Must be in chronological order of the submission. 
            Each of the 6 tasks is considered as separate challenges, and hence teams participating in more than
            one task must start with Submission_1 for each task submission. Subsequent submissions for a given task
            which may be outputs of the same system with different tuning will be considered as a different system,
            and should have the next system-number in increasing order. For eg. Team-ABC may make 3 submissions for 
            SD_track1 task, 4 submissions for SAD, and 1 for SID. Irrespective of the similarity or differences in
            the underlying systems, each task-specific system output on the (Dev and Eval) sets should be submitted
            in individual compressed submission packets. Illustrating the above example, consider the following
            submissions to FearlessSteps@utdallas.edu (can be sent in a single email or separate emails):
                    ABC@uni.edu_SD_track1_Submission_1.tar.gz, ABC@uni.edu_SD_track1_Submission_2.zip, 
                    ABC@uni.edu_SD_track1_Submission_3.tar.gz, ABC@uni.edu_SAD_Submission_1.tar.gz, 
                    ABC@uni.edu_SAD_Submission_2.zip,          ABC@uni.edu_SAD_Submission_3.tar.gz, 
                    A@uni.edu_SAD_Submission_4.tar.gz,         ABC@uni.edu_SID_Submission_1.tar.gz
        
        iv. extn : Must be a folder compressed to a ".zip" or ".tar.gz" format file.
    
    (REFER: "crss@utdallas.edu_ASR_track2_Submission_1.tar.gz" provided as an illustration
        in the submission packet folder of the toolkit)
        
3. System submissions will be accepted between May 1, 2020, 12.00am AOE and May 6, 2020, 12.00am AOE.
   The FS Team will reply to each email submission acknowledging the receipt of each teams' 
   submission packets.



================
Evaluation Rules
================

1. Both Dev and Eval system submissions will be scored. Only Eval set results will be considered 
   to rank teams for each Challenge. 

2. Results for each system submission will be sent privately to respective participants on May 7th.
   For every team, only the 5 best performing system submissions per task will be considered for the ranking.

3. Evaluation code available at https://github.com/AJoGaTech/FS02_Scoring_Toolkit will be used to score 
   all systems. Participants are expected to test their system output files using the Dev set
   ground truth labels to ensure proper formatting of all system outputs prior to submission.

4. Participants will be notified of their rankings on May 7, 2020 before 11.59pm AOE, which they can report 
   on their conference paper(s). The best performing systems will be displayed on the FS02 website 
   leaderboard under each team-name and system-number (<team-name>_system_<system-number>)
   (REFER: https://fearless-steps.github.io/ChallengePhase2/Final.html)

5. All Challenge participants are required to submit a conference paper(s) describing their systems 
   (and reporting performance on Dev and Eval sets) to the "FEARLESS STEPS CHALLENGE PHASE-2" 
   Special Sessions section at ISCA INTERSPEECH-2020. (Deadline: May 8, 2020)
